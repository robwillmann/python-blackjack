Basic blackjack design flow:

1. Initialization:
	a. Class: Deck of Cards
		1. Use dict generator to create a dict of: suit, name, value.
		2. Method: shuffle - simple - just use choose from random class. (IE: random.choiice(remainder_of_deck))
		1. Must keep track of cards already dealt.
	b. Method\Function: Deal a card.
 2. Each Hand (except initial deal)
 	- Deal 1 card from remainder of deck.
 	- Check for dealer = 21
 	- Check for bust.
